# Machine Learning

### **Project1**

The first project includes code for classification using the following classifiers:
-	Nearest Neighbor classifier using Euclidean distance
-	Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
-	Least-Squares Classifier
-	Gradient Descent with sigmoid function

### **Project2**

The second project includes code for clustering, specifically:
-	k-means using Euclidean distance. Initialization of k center randomly from the dataset
-	Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering 

In order to evaluate the two methods we use purity and F-measure
